### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?  
  
they have been a good indicator for me to know if i am taking to long on an exercise. so far i have managed to stay close  
to the reccomended times or a little bit longer but not by much.



# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?

The biggest problems i came across was either not reading the questions properly or small spelling syntax errors.  
they weren't hard problems to overcome, i just needed to carefully read over my code and eventually find the mistakes.  
  
  
### What are of you proud of from this challenge?  
  
I am proud of the little bit of study i had already done before the start of the course because it meant i was able to understand what i was looking at easier and not waste much time.  

I enjoyed learning about the responsive web design part because i needed to refresh myself on those and i think that the responsive design part of coding is very important, especially now days when everybody has a mobile device.  
  
# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?

I have been using the pomodoro method through the toggle timmer and have found it very useful to break down long working blocks to a more bite size size. This has mad it easier to get through long videos and freshin my brain to stay focused.

I am doing this after a big day and am a little tired which is limiting my attention span but it is the weekend tomorrow so i should be able to get a good rest and have another crack at it then.

### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?

I think the amount of information that was in the video was quite alot so i will try to overcome this by having a play around with the dev tools tomorrow and maybe watch some more of the video to refresh my mind.  
  
### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

I currently have three tabs open, the dev academy student handbook, the crash course youtube video and a newsletter from my iwi that i had opened from my emails earlier, so the newsletter was probably my only distraction tab.  

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.

yes, i changed the title on the Dev Academy Student handbook from "Dev Tools Tutorial" to "Im The Man" hahaha.  


# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  



### Any moments of surprise or joy? 



### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
