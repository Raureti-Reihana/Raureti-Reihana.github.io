# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

Using the Toggl track has been useful to stick to my learning strategy as it alows me to track time and also gives my head a break which seems to help alot with retention.  
Also having the Time Box has been a good indicator as to whether i am taking to long on an exercise or if i am rushing too much. I did find myself getting side tracked a bit and diving into thing more than i should out of curiosity which i need to be aware of.  
  
### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?  
  
I'm feeling fairly confident with everyting we have covered so far. I feel like the repetative use of the terminal allows us to practically use those skills which helps  to retain the commands and what they do. I still have lots to learn but i am really enjoying it.  
  
### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?  
  
I honestly have enjoyed everything so far because it is all new and particularly the core side of things which is preparing us i feel to be work ready and have good work ethics.  

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

Personally i found the personality test parts some what tedious, but i think that was more because i was under the impression that i had to have all of sprint-1 completed by sunday on the first week and i wasn't in the best mind frame at the time. Now that i have a better gage on the amount of time we have to do the work i will be spreading it out more over the two weeks.  

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

yes, there were times when i was saying to myself "Keep going, keep pushing through the mahi". In hind sight i think i could probably take more long breaks when i'm studying. So maybe setting a time limit for a finish time before i get started could be helpful.
