# My Reflections - Sprint One  
  
In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:  
  
# Command Line Primer  
  
<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->  
  
### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?  
  
- To my knowledge the command line is another way to interact with your PC without using the convetional system of the PC.  
- coming in the backdoor, you still have access to everything in the house as you would if you were to come through the front door   
but you have come in another way.  
  
### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?  
  
-no, i may have taken a little extra time to wrap my head around things, i wouldn't change anything yet as i am still fresh to everything and   
i'm still learning how to use timebox guidelines properly.  
  
### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.  
  
1. pwd = shows your current directory location  
2. cd = change directory  
3. rm = remove a file  
4. rm -rf = remove a directory  
5. mkdir = creates a new directory  
6. touch = creates a new file  
  
  
### Did you learn anything unexpected?  
   
no   
  
# Version Control with Git  
  
<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->  
 
### What's the difference between git and GitHub?  
  
To my understanding, "Git" is the software used for collaborative projects and is well known for its version control feature and "Github"  
is the place where Git repositories are hosted.  
  
after checking my answers i have found that Git is the version control system. Github hosts the Git Repository and allows you to work  
collaboratively with other Github users  
  
### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?  

i liken it to a book where Github is the book and Git is the contents and each leaf of the book are the different versions that you  
may return to re-read or in this case return to that version.  P.s not the best analogy haha  
  
### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?  
  
yes, but some of the small details may be forgotten in that amount of time. it would be wise to revist/reflect another time to solidify the  
infomation.  
  
### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?  
  
yes  
  
# Install and Explore Git

### What is a Git workflow?  
  
a Git workflow is reccomended way of using Git. The exercise gave me a good understanding of how to comment on commits to help anyone that  
is trying to understand what has been changed, added or deleted. unless your workplace has a different way of working you should definately  
adopt this workflow.  
  
### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?  
  
i had a few of these moments espesialy when doing the Version Control with Git Course. i felt it was not clear enough in some exercises  
and ended up wasting time. The positive is that it forced met to do more of my own reasearch on google to assist.  
  
### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?  
  
no  
  
# Track and Commit 
  
<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->  
  
### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?  
  
i think of the stage and commit process as three stages.  
  
1. when you make a change in your git directory on your local network, the command line recognises that you have a change that has not yet  
been tracked by Git. let's call this stage "untracked changes".  
  
2. after the "untracked changes" stage we will now use the command 'git add', this will move any pending changes to the next stage which  
we will call "Staging Index". The "Staging Index" helps to merge other versions of the project, for example if you and another are working  
on the same project but different versions.   
  
3. after our changes have moved to the staging index we are now ready to commit these changes. We will now use the command 'git commit'.  
Git will now track the change and add it to the log of other commits we have already made which we can look at with 'git log'.  
   
basicaly  
  
you make changes > send changes to stage > commit change to be recoreded by git  
  
# Branch, Pull, Merge  
  
<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->  
  
### What is main?  
  
main is the main or master version of a project.  
  
### Why create a Branch?  
  
you would create a branch so you can work on another version of the main, sort of like a duplicate. this allows you to be able to make  
commits without worrying about affecting the main. it also gives you or others to review your code before merging it back to the main.  

### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  
  
yes they do. I feel i am getting a fair amount of understanding of these concepts for the amount of time i've put in so far.  
the practicle side really helps me retain more information.  
  
# GitHub Fork & Clone  
  
<!-- Answer the following questions -->  
  
### What are some examples of when you would fork?  
  
When you want to use an existing repo as a starting point for your own project or if you don't have permissions to edit the original repo.  
   
### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?  
  
yes, once i found out that i needed to clone using the ssh instead of the url to clone the repo.  
  
# Setup Repo & Create Blog  
  
### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?  
  
i felt frustrated when i couldn't remember some of the commands but i was able to go back to previous commands in the command line.  
    
### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?  
  
I originaly thought it would be more writing code than setting up the places and processes for the code live and be shared with others.  
These skills are very valuable though as i can see how important these skills would be in the workplace.  


# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?

I will first identify the problem and then i will atempt to solve it on my own. If i still haven't solved the problem i will then look to the internet for a solution and if i am  
still having trouble then i will aproach someone that i know that could help me understand the problem and work together for a solution.  
  
### Have a look at what the internet says on how to think like a programmer. What patterns do you see? What do you notice?  
  
The common theme is that programmers are or should be good problem solvers rather than just being able to write good code.  
  
### What does the internet say about flipped learning? What is flipped learning and flipped classroom? How do you think it will relate to your learning journey?  
  
From what i found, flipped learning is the opposite order to the conventional way of learning where instead of going to class to work out of text books, sit in lectures and then  
going home to do homework, you actually learn about the topics first at home so that when you come to the classroom you already have a basic knowledge of the topics and  
are able to dive into deeper learning along side your peers rather than struggling by your self at home.  
  
# Introduce yourself  
  
### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?  
  
  It was a little difficult trying to summarise everything because there are so many things i could have talked about but in the end i was able to share parts of life that are most important to me, which is mainly family and culture.  
  

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?  

Yes i felt proud of the person i am and a great sense of gratitude for my life.  
  
I was some what conscious, but i feel like you can easily get into a flow state when your expressing your  true authentic self.
