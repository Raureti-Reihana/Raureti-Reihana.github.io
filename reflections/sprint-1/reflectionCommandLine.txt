**How would you describe the command line in plain English in a couple of sentences? Can you think of an analogy for it?**

- To my knowledge the command line is another way to interact with your PC without using the convetional system of the PC.  
- coming in the backdoor, you still have access to everything in the house as you would if you were to come through the front door   
but you have come in another way.  
  
  
**Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?**  
  
-no, i may have taken a little extra time to wrap my head around things, i wouldn't change anything yet as i am still fresh to everything and     
i'm still learning how to use timebox guidelines properly.  
  
**Name five commands you used and what they do.**  
  
ls = lists all files and directories in the current directiory   
ls -al = this command also lists all files and directories in the current directory but also gives extra information for those items  
i.e. write and read permissions, file size, last date modefied and more that i am yet to learn.  
pwd = shows your current directory location  
cd = change directory  
rm = remove a file  
rm -rf = remove a directory  
mkdir = creates a new directory

**Did you learn anything unexpected?**
