          <h2>Learning Plan - Foundations</h2>

          <h3><strong> What is your long term goal or career pathway? </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> My long term goal is to be able to work remotely and have the skills to contribute to projects for my iwi and teach others 
          from my iwi about coding.<br>
          In between now and then I would love to be in a workplace that allows me to learn while working.</p>

          <h3><strong> Description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation">I would say my strengths lie in my curiosity and perseverance. If i am curious and interested in what i am learning then i can 
          continue to keep diving into learning without getting tired.<br>
          My limitations for learning would mainly be time. I have a responsibility to take care and provide for my family in all aspects 
          and is one of my highest priorities and this can take a lot of my time. At the same time my family is one of my biggest 
          motivations to push through hard times and persevere. </p>

          <h3><strong> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </strong>
          </h3>
            
          <p class="explanation">I would like to develop my time management skills, so I can efficiently finish my work without the stress of deadlines.<br> 
          Since starting Dev Academy I have noticed the huge value in these types of skills and have seen the positive effect these 
          skills have had on my work ethics.<br>
          I would also like to be more of a contributor when it comes to working with other people</p>

          <h3><strong> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </strong><br>
          This should include:</h3>

          <p class="explanation"> Commit to engaging in some form of learning in relation to the curriculum at least once per day. If it isn‚Äôt direct work in 
          the curriculum then it can be a video that helps me to understand the current exercise so the following day I can come up with 
          a solution. If work gets on top of me i will seek support from family to help with kids to give me more focused time.</p>

          <h3><strong> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way </strong></h3>

          <P>I commit to asking for help on discord or from my cousin who is a developer after spending more than 20 mins on something i am 
          stuck ong>	A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> I expect the facilitators to try their best to help me when I get stuck and persevere when I am struggling to understand a 
          concept. The facilitators have been top tier this far üòÄ</p>

          <h3><strong> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have 
            whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> Yes I have a daily schedule which consists of gym, school drop offs, work, pickups, dinner and study. Extra time to 
            study during weekends. </p>
          
          <h2>Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h2>

          <h3><strong> What is your long term goal or career pathway? </strong></h3>
  
          <p class="explanation"> I would like to get a job in web development and be part of an environment that helps me to continue to learn and widen my programming knowledge and skills.
          I want to have the flexibility to work remotely and have better work life balance.
          I would also like to be able to teach these skills to my iwi in the future in hopes of helping those interested move into the tech industry.</p>
  
          <h3><strong> What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp? </strong></h3>
  
          <p class="explanation">Looking at my previous answers from sprint-2, nothing has changed. My strengths lie in my curiosity and perseverance. My limitations for learning would mainly be time. I have a responsibility to take care and provide for my family in all aspects and is one of my highest priorities and this can take a lot of my time. At the same time my family is one of my biggest motivations to push through hard times and persevere. </p>

          <h3><strong> What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
          </strong></h3>
  
          <p class="explanation">I think my biggest challenges will be keeping up with the work. I have been managing to keep up with the work so far but I am needing all of my spare time that I have and to think bootcamp is going to be 1.5x the amount of work now is a bit daunting. I think having to talk in front of people more often could be challenging but I am willing to take these challenges on. </p>
  
          <h3><strong> What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </strong>
          </h3>
              
          <p class="explanation">I think I do quite well with my time management but with the extra workload I think I may need to tighten up my time management even more or even work less hours at work. 
          I would also like to work on my communicating skills with other students.</p>
  
          <h3><strong> What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong></h3>
  
          <p class="explanation"> I expect that the bootcamp team is there to support us just like they have for the start of this course. The team is very quick to reply and really makes it easy for us to stay on track without losing focus on the current activity.</p>
  
          <h3><strong> What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp? </strong></h3>
  
          <P>I will continue to ask for help in the discord and I will also be using chat gpt to assist me to understand concepts and methods.
          I commit to setting aside one day per week where I will meet with other people that are in my team when we are pair programming, preferably during the weekend so we can discuss, plan and work together.
          I commit to being open minded and accepting of others work styles and do my best to adapt and work cohesively. We can do this by discussing and planning every time before we start working.</P>
