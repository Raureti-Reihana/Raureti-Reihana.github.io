          <h2>Learning Plan</h2>

          <h3><strong> What is your long term goal or career pathway? </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> My long term goal is to be able to work remotely and have the skills to contribute to projects for my iwi and teach others 
          from my iwi about coding.<br>
          In between now and then I would love to be in a workplace that allows me to learn while working.</p>

          <h3><strong> Description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation">I would say my strengths lie in my curiosity and perseverance. If i am curious and interested in what i am learning then i can 
          continue to keep diving into learning without getting tired.<br>
          My limitations for learning would mainly be time. I have a responsibility to take care and provide for my family in all aspects 
          and is one of my highest priorities and this can take a lot of my time. At the same time my family is one of my biggest 
          motivations to push through hard times and persevere. </p>

          <h3><strong> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </strong>
          </h3>
            
          <p class="explanation">I would like to develop my time management skills, so I can efficiently finish my work without the stress of deadlines.<br> 
          Since starting Dev Academy I have noticed the huge value in these types of skills and have seen the positive effect these 
          skills have had on my work ethics.<br>
          I would also like to be more of a contributor when it comes to working with other people</p>

          <h3><strong> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </strong><br>
          This should include:</h3>

          <p class="explanation"> Commit to engaging in some form of learning in relation to the curriculum at least once per day. If it isn‚Äôt direct work in 
          the curriculum then it can be a video that helps me to understand the current exercise so the following day I can come up with 
          a solution. If work gets on top of me i will seek support from family to help with kids to give me more focused time.</p>

          <h3><strong> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way </strong></h3>

          <P>I commit to asking for help on discord or from my cousin who is a developer after spending more than 20 mins on something i am 
          stuck ong>	A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> I expect the facilitators to try their best to help me when I get stuck and persevere when I am struggling to understand a 
          concept. The facilitators have been top tier this far üòÄ</p>

          <h3><strong> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have 
            whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> Yes I have a daily schedule which consists of gym, school drop offs, work, pickups, dinner and study. Extra time to 
            study during weekends. </p>
