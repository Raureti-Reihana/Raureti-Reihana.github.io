          <h2>Raureti learning plan</h2>

          <strong> What is your long term goal or career pathway? </strong><br>

          My long term goal is to be able to work remotely and have the skills to contribute to projects for my iwi and teach others 
          from my iwi about coding.
          In between now and then I would love to be in a workplace that allows me to learn while working.<br>

          <strong> Description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </strong><br>

          I would say my strengths lie in my curiosity and perseverance. If i am curious and interested in what i am learning then i can 
          continue to keep diving into learning without getting tired.
          My limitations for learning would mainly be time. I have a responsibility to take care and provide for my family in all aspects 
          and is one of my highest priorities and this can take a lot of my time. At the same time my family is one of my biggest 
          motivations to push through hard times and persevere. <br>

          <strong> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </strong>
          <br>
            
          I would like to develop my time management skills, so I can efficiently finish my work without the stress of deadlines. 
          Since starting Dev Academy I have noticed the huge value in these types of skills and have seen the positive effect these skills have had on my work 
          ethics.
          I would also like to be more of a contributor when it comes to working with other people

          <strong> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </strong><br>
          This should include:<br>

          I commit to engaging in some form of learning in relation to the curriculum at least once per day. If it isn‚Äôt direct work in 
          the curriculum then it can be a video that helps me to understand the current exercise so the following day I can come up with 
          a solution. If work gets on top of me i will seek support from family to help with kids to give me more focused time.<br>

          <strong> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way </strong><br>

          I commit to asking for help on discord or from my cousin who is a developer after spending more than 20 mins on something i am 
          stuck on<br>
          <strong>	A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team </strong><br>

          I expect the facilitators to try their best to help me when I get stuck and persevere when I am struggling to understand a 
          concept. The facilitators have been top tier this far üòÄ<br>

          <strong> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have 
            whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. </strong><br>

          Yes I have a daily schedule which consists of gym, school drop offs, work, pickups, dinner and study. Extra time to study during 
          weekends.
