          <h2>Mahere Tapa Whā</h2>

          <h3><strong> Taha Tinana </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> One of the ways I take care of my physical health is by going to the gym 6-4 days of the week. I really enjoy challenging 
            myself physically and have got into the habit of waking up at 5.00am so i can get to the gym early before mahi.
          </p>
          <p class="explanation"> When I started at Dev Academy I knew I was going to be getting into serious mode and have been eating 
            clean since then which has helped me to stay energized and focused while i am working and studying.
          </p>
          <p class="explanation"> My typical day starts at 5.00am, get to gym at 5.30-5.45, leave about 7.00, get home 7.15, make kids lunch/ my lunch, 
            make kids/ my breakfast, have shower, leave home 8.20, drop kids off at kura and kohanga, get to work at 9.00, chicken and broccoli for lunch at 12.00pm, 
            leave work at 2.45, pick kids up, get home around 3.30, relax for an hour, study, make dinner, study, in bed around 9.30 sleep by 10.30 latest. Weekends 
            are little bit more relaxed but i still like to gym and eat good even though it is the weekend
          </p>
          <p class="explanation"> I try my best to get enough sleep so my body and mind can recover. It’s very important to me if I want those gains at the gym and 
            the gains in the mind.
          </p>

          <h3><strong> Taha Whanau </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation">Taha whanau is definitely an area I need to work in. I feel like i can easily get consumed in all my studying, gym and eating. 
            I don’t spend as much quality time with them as I'd like. It seems like most of the time I do spend with my wife and kids these days is when 
            i’m cooking dinner or telling the kids off. Don’t get me wrong, we do manage to have many fun moments but just not as much as i’d like. 
            I am currently working two jobs which also take up alot of my time. For me doing this course is a stepping stone towards a solid job that will 
            one day allow me to have more time to spend with my Family and live the lifestyle we want. </p>
          <p class="explanation"> Something I do enjoy with my family is when we are all cleaning doing our jobs around the house on the weekend with our 
            music playing. My wife and I get a little groove on and the kids love to boogie and we have a fun time.
          </p>

          <h3><strong> Taha Hinengaro </strong>
          </h3>
            
          <p class="explanation">Like I have said in previous blogs, I like to use my emotional intelligence, especially my self awareness. 
            Being aware of different emotions and behavior helps me to regulate and evaluate what I need to do next. Being able to catch 
            myself in a moment and being more responsive then reactive can definitely help to overcome challenges and keep my head level.
          </p>
          <p class="explanation">One thing I could do to improve my taha hinengaro would be meditation. I use to do it alot but haven’t 
            done it in a while. Maybe if I try to do some meditation before bed and think about what I need to get done the following 
            day then I could possibly be more productive.
          </p>

          <h3><strong> Taha Wairua </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> I am fortunate enough to live right by the beach and it is literally on the other side of the road. 
            I often have moments of gratitude where I can just stare across the ocean and think how fortunate my family and I are to live in this place surrounded by whanau here in the pā.
            Our marae is also just down the road and then our urupa is up on the hill so whenever I feel like I need guidance or strength I think of those places and talk my tupuna through thought.
            I have a great connection to this place, my tūrangawaewae and am very secure with my taha wairua.
