          <h2>Overview - Foundations Core Skills</h2>

          <h3><strong>  What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</strong></h3>
          
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p class="explanation"> I have learnt that I generally have a good attitude towards learning, cooperating with others. Prior to Dev Academy I had already started on my self improvement journey. I Feel like this has helped me to move forward with a growth mindset which in turn helps me to learn without limiting myself. The old me would have said “This is too hard, i can’t do this and i give up” and i would have never enjoyed the fruits of my labor. Having that same attitude towards working with others also removes those limits and changes the narrative from “Oh know i have to work with someone else, what a drag” to “how exciting, i get to work with someone else and hopefully we can learn something from each other”.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="explanation"> I have also learnt about the side of myself that is negative. I have found parts of this course very challenging, especially the technical skills. These things have pushed me quite hard and have made me go through a lot of emotions that I don't particularly like to feel. The positive of this is that when I am feeling like that, in my mind, I feel like I am in the learning zone and struggle often accompanies progress. Learning about these core skills have helped me to  acknowledge those feelings and then take a breath and have a break before carrying on.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="explanation">In my opinion I feel like I have learnt that I am quite capable of working with others and being a part of a team is not as hard for me as I think it is.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3><strong> What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation">In my opinion values allow one to be true to themself. By sticking to those values whether that is being true to your word by finishing work on time or just being honest about your situation and why you have or haven’t done something. In short, values keep you accountable and the only person that knows whether you truly learnt something is yourself.
            Empathy allows one to understand what a programmer of user is trying to portray or needs. Empathy can also be helpful when working with others and make you think from the perspective of someone that is completely new to a piece of code.
            Self awareness is super important when it comes to learning and programing. Self awareness helps us to recognise when we are doing great, feeling good and have the stamina to carry on or when we are tired and strung out and need a break. Self awareness makes us aware of when we might be having self doubt or negative self talk and be able to recognise and adjust the mindset.            
          </p>

          <h3><strong> What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </strong></h3>
            
          <p class="explanation">What surprised me the most about learning core is the deeper connection I got to make with myself. I felt like I was able to get to know myself a bit better even if it was just a little bit. It allowed me to take a step back from myself and kind of observe from an outside perspective and take a look at the things I do and the things I can do to improve and help myself improve in not only programming and learning, but in life.
          </p>

          <h3><strong> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> I’d say the most challenging part of core learning to me is having to plan. I have always been the person who goes with the flow. I now know that this attitude can really slow my progress towards my goals and doesn’t allow me to have clear intentions and focus.
          </p>

          <h3><strong> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course? </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation">I think there has been a major focus on core learning in this course because the reality is in the workplace that you do not always have the comfort of working solo and you will be expected to be part of a team and be able to communicate effectively. Also being able to manage your emotions when things get challenging and being able to communicate with others will be important so they can know how to help you.</p>

          <h3><strong> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer. </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation">I have had these thoughts when going through the core learning but quickly remind myself that if I am trying to get a job in the industry and these are the skills I need to land the job then I will take it all in as much as I can. Honestly I have enjoyed it as well. I have been able to take a look at myself and feel proud of who I am as a person.</p>
