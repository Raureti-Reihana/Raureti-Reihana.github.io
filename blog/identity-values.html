          <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
          <h3><strong> Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that 
            decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now. </strong></h3>

          <p> I think being a māori, we run into these types of situations quite a lot. For some of us we have grown up under tikanga 
            māori, which can conflict with the way that others may do things. For example, I have been in a situation where I have had 
            a whanaunga (relative) pass away and because of my values and tikanga it becomes a choice whether to go to the tangi 
            (funeral) or not get paid and potentially lose my job. Fortunately I did not lose my job and I was able to attend the 
            tangi  but there was definitely a moment there where there was a tug between doing what I felt was the right thing to 
            do and doing what someone else wants me to do because it disadvantages them or the team.
            Looking back at it, I wouldn't change a thing. My whanau is very important to me and I value time shared with them 
            very highly. Yes I may have more money in the pocket the following week but I would have missed out on that time 
            with the whanau and also feel bad for not doing my part to contribute to the marae and well being of the whanau grieving.</p>

           
          <h3><strong> Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity. </strong></h3>

          <p> Where I live is near our marae and I grew up as a “pā kid”. I had countless times being at the marae for many events 
              and grew up to have a deep connection with the place and people. Growing up in this way you take on a lot of the values 
              of those around you and it becomes a way of life. People may recognise words like manaakitanga, kaitiakitanga or 
              kotahitanga, all these concepts and more are all taught by living through it and countless growlings lol. 
              But I feel like I had the best upbringing in the world and wouldn’t change it for anything.</p>

          <h3><strong> Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey. </strong></h3>

          <p> Some of my strengths I think would be the ability to adapt to situations and/or people. For the most part I can identify 
            what isn’t going so good for me and pivot and adjust to the situation. You can make a mistake once or twice but the third 
            time is a choice. I feel like I can work with most others without problems. Usually I will be able to find some common 
            ground and be able to build rapport with others.
            I think these strengths will benefit me during my learning journey because it means that  I am open and willing to 
            hear ideas before making the decision whether that information is valuable or not. 
            Although I don't mind working alone, I think being able to relate to others will help me to learn new things and 
            be able to ask for help without being shy or embarrassed.</p>

          <h3><strong> your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning 
            journey? </strong></h3>

          <p> I have a part time job and a family which is definitely my biggest limitations as it affects the amount of time i have to study 
            during the week, but my family is one of the main reasons I have chosen to pursue this type of work as well as having an interest 
            in tech. Despite these hurdles i am determined and committed to soaking up all this knowledge and i will pass this course. 
            The main thing for me is sticking to my habits like studying daily and managing my time optimally by planning my next day.
            Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. </p>

          <h3><Strong>Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies 
              you would try now and why. </Strong></h3>

          <p> can’t say that I have had this type of thing happen to me much personally but if there were times like this, i would say it
             would be because the other person did not agree with what work was being done for whatever reason or they did not fully 
             understand what was happening and end  up getting frustrated. <br>
            In these situations i would try my best to help the person understand what is going on and encourage them to help us as part 
            of a team. <br> 
            Sometimes people can feel like they are being told what to do  rather than working with you, so if I ever need to 
            ask people help or do something, I will ask them to help but also let them know what I am going to be doing so they 
            feel like they are more of a contributor to the team rather than just being told. I have used this method in the past 
            and seems to go well with others.<br></p>
            
          <p> “Ehara taku toa i te toa takitahi, engari kē he toa takitini” </p>

          <p>Tēnā tātou! My name Is Raureti Reihana but you can call me Rau for short if you like.<br>
            I was born and breed in Porirua.<br>
            Diving into the Identity, Values, and Strengths part of the curriculum was interesting and really reminded me of 
            how proud I am to be the person I am. The exercise about the blog gave me the opportunity to recognise the things 
            i have/had and gave me a great sense of gratitude to have the upbringing i did. The place i grew up and call home 
            is called Hongoeka and all the houses in that area are filled with relations, so that meant that we had this big 
            area as our playground and all us “paa kids” really were raised as a village which has had a huge impact on my 
            values and identity.</p>

          <p>I’ve always been into tech and found navigating a computer fairly easy and at this stage of my life I'm looking for a 
            new challenge to push my limits. One of my cousins works as a Junior Dev and thought I would enjoy coding and 
            recommended Dev Academy as many of his colleagues had come through the course. Another reason I have come here 
            is to set my family up for the future. I am no longer able to stand for long periods of time without getting sore 
            so this type of mahi seems to tick all the boxes.<br>
            Looking forward to soaking up all this knowledge and finding my place in the coding world!!</p>
