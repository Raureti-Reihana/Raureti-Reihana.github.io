          <h2>Problem Solving</h2>

          <h3><strong>  A time when you were blocked on a simple problem </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> I had a problem where I couldn't get through one of the Javascript kata challenges. I ran the test for the javascript-kata challenges and then read the error messages. I also used the test.js files to see what exactly the challenge was looking for. Even after using these techniques I found myself getting stuck and nothing was working so I reached out for help from peers and facilitators to help me out.
          </p>
          <p class="explanation"> It was a little bit stressful at times but I took a break and a breathe and tried again. Another tool I used to help me understand the layout and order for my code was chat-gpt. I was able to ask it for examples similar to what I was doing and then plug in my own inputs. I was then able to use that tool to break down each line of code and even specific parts within that line so I could fully understand what is happening and why I should have things in that order.
          </p>

          <h3><strong> A time when you elegantly solved a problem. </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation">Going through the steps on the challenge to do with manipulating an object. It was very challenging as it was mostly all new information for me. I tried my best to solve the problem with the little knowledge I had on the subject but to no avail. I then reached out for help on the discord and was led in the right direction from one of the facilitators. Using pseudocode and other techniques didn’t really help me because I really had no idea what I was doing. This led me to return to the old faithful technique of research, research, research. I felt a little bit down at times because it felt like i was trying to run before i could walk and like i had a problem to solve and didn’t know what to do next to help myself but i kept it cool and dug around and eventually found the answer. In the end I came to the realization that I needed to use other ways of making changes to variables by way of dot notation and also making sure my code was in the right order from top to bottom.

          <h3><strong> Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes: </strong></h3>
            
          <p class="explanation">There are a few ways we can increase our neuroplasticity, and they are in my opinion the basics to living a healthy lifestyle.
            Things we might do to increase neuroplasticity are:
            <ul>
              <li>Pseudocode</li>
                <p>While doing the javascript-kata challenges i felt like the way they had the instructions was already similar to pseudocode, something perhaps i could have done is to try and simplify those instructions even more and break them down.</p>
              <li>Trying something</li>
                <p>This is probably my most used technique, just because I like to see how much of the challenge I can do on my own before I need to ask for help or do more research into the task. I often try something to see if it works and if it doesn’t then I will try changing something else again. The downside to this is that the code can get messy and then I have a bunch of missed attempts all mixed into one.
                </p>
              <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
                <p>Didn’t use this method because I honestly don’t know enough about this part of JS and I can't come up with any answers without seeking help from somewhere, but I will get there.</p>
              <li>Reading error messages</li>
                <p>This was very helpful because it would give you a clue and I would be able to think to myself, “this is what it expects the answer to be and how can I get to that point”. It also gives you a point where you can almost work backwards to find the how in between.</p>
              <li>Console.logging</li>
                <p>I do like this technique but am unsure of how to console.log out when i’m using JS in vscode. I will find out, because this is really handy to see what bits of codes are currently outputting</p>
              <li>Googling</li>
                <p>I did a lot of googling, especially when trying to figure out the terms and jargon. It was especially useful when I was learning about different array methods.</p>
              <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
                <p>Have had to do this a couple of times because I get to a spot and I don't know what to do from there.</p>
              <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
                <p>I have noticed the amount of information that I have been able to retain during this course with all the reflections and can see why they want us to do it so often. It is a very powerful tool and something I should implement into my life outside of Dev Academy as well.</p>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><strong> Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time? </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> I felt reluctant to ask for help after the first time of asking for help from our coaches. I know it's the wrong way to think but sometimes I feel embarrassed to say that I still don’t understand what they are saying, even though they would rather we did ask and it was in plain english hahaha. Next time I will ask chat gpt so I don’t have to talk to anyone hahaha, nah i will just continue to keep asking.
