            <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
            <h3><strong> What is Emotional Intelligence? </strong></h3>

            <p> Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise, feel, regulate, empathize and control emotions. This can be in many different forms or situations, 
              for example, sometimes when I read my book, my mind can drift away from what I am reading. Even though my eyes are still following the words, 
              my mind isnâ€™t taking in the information being read. Using emotional intelligence in my opinion would be the ability to recognise that your mind 
              has started to wander and then re-focusing on your book to take in what is actually being said. This would be a form of self awareness and self 
              regulation which are both parts of emotional intelligence. <br>
              Other parts of emotional intelligence include empathy and social skills which also go hand in hand, for instance, when you are meeting someone 
              new and you are getting to know one and other, people often start with questions like what is your name?, where are you from and what do you like 
              to do in your spare time?. This form of emotional intelligence would be social skills. The point of asking questions like these is to find common 
              ground between you and the person you are talking to. This helps to build rapport and in turn strengthen your relationship to move towards a common goal. 
              This side of emotional intelligence can be very helpful when working as a team or seeking out a new love interest. ðŸ˜‰<br>
              Once you have built a relationship with someone, you can further strengthen that relationship by showing empathy. For example when someone is going 
              through a tough time and they explain their situation, you can share a time when you were in a similar. situation and offer advice based on how you 
              dealt with or how you should have dealt with the situation. <br>
              </p>

            
            <h3><strong> How is EQ different to IQ? </strong></h3>

            <p> Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise, feel, regulate, empathize and control emotions, where as Iq is more the ability to solve 
              problems and think analytically. </p>

            <h3><strong> Why is EQ important? </strong></h3>

            <p> Emotional intelligence is important because it helps us to socialize with others whether it is in a social or work environment. 
              Humans are social beings and it is easy for most of us to communicate and work together. We often see high levels of emotional 
              intelligence in leaders because they know how to interact with others, control their emotions and defuse conflict.</p>
