          <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>

          <h3><strong> Neuroplasticity </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> Neuroplasticity is the ability for our brains to grow, stretch and adapt with experience. 
            The brain is able to learn from experiences and adapt by making neural paths which become stronger and thicker with repetition of a thought.
          </p>
          <p class="explanation"> Once we are aware of Neuroplasticity, we then realize that we are all born with the ability to learn and that the old 
            thoughts we once had and believed like “I can’t do this, i can’t do that” are just blocks or limits we have put on ourselves. We also realize 
            that we can learn easier, we make better lifestyle choices and generally have a better perspective on all things by finding the positives in all situations.
          </p>

          <h3><strong> How you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit. </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation">For me, I feel like being aware of this thing “neuroplasticity” gives me a better perspective of how I look at myself 
            compared to others in terms of learning and recalling information. Although I may not understand something as fast as someone else or I might 
            not be able to connect neurons and make neural pathways as fast as someone else doesn’t mean that I can't ever get to the same level as someone else. 
            As long as I can stay committed to something and practice, practice, practice then my brain will eventually make the connections and get stronger 
            with each effort of practice. So I would engage the principles of neuroplasticity by consistently practicing what I want to learn. </p>

          <h3><strong> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity? </strong>
          </h3>
            
          <p class="explanation">There are a few ways we can increase our neuroplasticity, and they are in my opinion the basics to living a healthy lifestyle.
            Things we might do to increase neuroplasticity are:
            <ul>
              <li>Putting yourself into challenging situations which force you to find a solution</li>
              <li>Physical exercise</li>
              <li>Healthy diet</li>
              <li>Adequate sleep</li>
              <li>Meditation</li>
              <li>Learning a language</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><strong> Growth Mindset </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> Growth Mindset is the idea that we have the ability to overcome obstacles and challenges with enough 
            hardwork and dedication. Someone with a growth mindset is usually optimistic towards most situations and has a strong belief 
            in themselves to achieve whatever they set out to do so long as they put in the work.
          </p>

          <h3><strong> In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you? </strong></h3>

          <P class="explanation">Nothing really surprised me as I have already explored this avenue prior to coming to Dev Academy, 
            but it is a good reminder to stay in a growth mindset and continue to thrive.</P>

          <h3><strong> How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey? </strong></h3>

          <P class="explanation">In the last few years I have been on a self improvement journey and have improved my life in many areas, 
            like health, mindfulness, relationships and general learning. On this journey of self improvement and growth I have come across the 
            growth mindset and have seen the way my life has transformed since then. I also believe being open to all ideas is good for learning, 
            but we must be able to take those ideas and filter out what is useful and what doesn’t serve us. This is not to say that I know all 
            there is to know about the topic andI believe learning is lifelong and I strive to be a life time student.</P>

          <P class="explanation">I read this book a couple of years back which is an awesome read called Limitless by Jim Kwik. In this book he 
            gives his experience from being limited to limitless and is very relevant to having a growth mindset.</P>
