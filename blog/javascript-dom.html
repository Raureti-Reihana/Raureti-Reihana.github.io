          <h2>JS Fundamentals</h2>

          <h3><strong> What is Javascript? </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> JavaScript is the Programming Language that can update and change both HTML and CSS. 
          It gives interactivity and functionality to websites.<br>
          When I'm explaining the relationship between HTML, CSS and Javascript I always use the analogy of a house 
          which makes it easier for me to remember and explain.<br>
          So let's imagine that we have our house which starts off with our frames. We can liken this to HTML as it is 
          the bones and the foundation to our house and also gives us our structure to build upon. Just like the frames 
          of our house, html is quite boring by itself and doesn’t show much character, that's where CSS comes in.<br>
          We can pretend that CSS is all the things that give our house its character whether it's the color of paint 
          on the wall, the type of cladding or the positioning of the windows. CSS can be as boring or as out there as 
          you like the choice is yours.<br>
          Finally Javascript is similar to all the interactive features that we have in our house like turning on and 
          off light switches or water taps, closing and opening doors or even house rules e.g “if you make a mess then you clean it up!!”<br>
          So HTML gives us our foundation and structure, CSS gives us our design and styling and Javascript gives us functionality and protocol.
          </p>

          <h3><strong> Control Flow, Conditionals and Loops </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"><strong>Control Flow</strong> is the order in how the computer reads code. Typically it reads from top to bottom.<br>
          Here’s an analogy to help you understand. Let’s imagine you are baking a cake and we have a recipe/method. While we are baking our cake we 
          follow our method from start to finish, top to bottom. Imagine trying to make a cake from the bottom up, it just wouldn’t work.<br>
          <strong>Conditionals</strong> can be if statements and if else statements which simply put are, if this is doing this then do this or else do this. 
          Similar to following our recipe for our cake, if our cake mixture is too dry then add milk or else keep mixing.<br>
          <strong>Loops</strong> have different types but can be simply used and thought of as, continue to repeat this step until this condition is met. 
          So if we use our 
          cake making analogy again we could say, keep mixing and adding milk until the desired consistency is met. </p>

          <h3><strong> What is the DOM? </strong>
          </h3>
            
          <p class="explanation">The <strong>DOM</strong> or <strong>Document Object Model</strong> is a programming interface or a 
          representation of all the elements 
          in a web page document that is able to be manipulated with Javascript.</p>
          <p class="explanation"><strong>Document</strong> refers to the webpage.</p>
          <p class="explanation"><strong>Object</strong> refers to the elements of that web page e.g  p tags, body tags and img tags.<br></p>
          <p class="explanation"><strong>Model</strong> refers to the relationship between each element.<br></p>
          <p class="explanation">The DOM can be imagined as a dynamic view of an HTML file. If we think of it in a tree arrangement like this</p>
          <img src="../blog-images/the-HTML-dom-tree-of-objects.gif" alt="DOM tree"><br>
          <p class="explanation">Then it gives us a visual representation and we can imagine every element or part of this tree as a node.<br></p>
          <p class="explanation">If we want to interact with the DOM we can do things like access elements,  create new elements, remove elements, 
          modify content of elements and respond to events.</p> 

          <h3><strong> Difference between Arrays and Objects </strong></h3>

          <p class="explanation"> Arrays and Objects are both variables that store and organize data. The biggest differences 
          between the two is the way they are accessed and the types of data they show.<br>
          Arrays are typically used for storing data with similar items like this:<br>
          <img class="button" src="../blog-images/array-example1.png" alt="array example-1">
          <img class="button" src="../blog-images/array-example1-console.png" alt="array example-1-console"><br>
          Where as Objects usually are a collection of different types of data like this:<br>
          <img class="button" src="../blog-images/object-example-rauretiProfile.png" alt="object example-1">
          <img class="button" src="../blog-images/object-example-rauretiProfile-console.png" alt="object example-1-console"><br>
          Arrays are accessed and utilized using their numerical index and Objects are accessed with their keys.
          </p>

          <h3><strong> What are functions? </strong></h3>

          <P class="explanation">A function is a block of code that performs the actions that have been specified within that block of code. 
            This allows us to keep blocks of code more manageable and easy to use. As a function, these blocks of code will 
            not be used until they are called on like this.</P><br>
